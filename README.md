# Makematics: Math for Makers

## About

This is a website dedicated to turning computer science research into maker tools. See the introductory blog post to learn more about the project: [Math for Makers](http://www.makematics.com/2012/03/23/math-for-makers/).

## How You Can Help

We're just getting started. Here are some things you can do:

* Add interesting papers, concepts, and programming techniques to the [research page](http://makematics.com/research/).

* Write-up explanations of any of the existing topics listed on that page.

* Gather links and material for any of the topics listed on that page.

* Write implementations of the ideas listed on that page and contribute them.

* Interview practitioners and researchers about their work (see [the Kyle McDonald interview](http://makematics.com/research/facetracker) to get an idea of the format).

* Do anything else you can think of for advancing Makematics' goals and talk to us about how to integrate it.
